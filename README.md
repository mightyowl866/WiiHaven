WiiHaven is a Desktop GUI program that lets you combine your Steam, GOG, EGS library and more, all in the style of the Wii Menu!
# To-Do list
- Add ability to add games from Steam/GOG/EGS library either through their EXE. files or AppId's
- Add ability to remove games.
- Add function to app that let's the user add their own media for their games. Things such as art for the tiles, a jingle that plays when you click on the game, etc.
- Return those DVD's from Blockbuster. Surely they're open in 2024? .....Right?
- Further Fine tuning and improvements. Looking to reduce the load on ram if possible.
- Clean up the code, and provide better documentation
